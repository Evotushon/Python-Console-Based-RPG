# Description

This project is a Console based RPG made with Python with some builtin functions that make this game more like an RPG than of a Visual Novel that only asks you where to go.

## Instructions

When the game asks you a "yes/no" question, reply with "y" or "n" without the quotes, obviously
<!--Update this when the combat function is released-->
The builtin functions are still in-dev so for now you shouldn't worry about that
